# Who Talked About Us?

## üëã Introduction

"Who Talked About Us?" is an influencer-filtering app where a user can:

1. Create an index (a library of videos)
2. Upload YouTube videos in bulk by (public) playlist ID, channel ID, or JSON file
3. Filter the videos and channels that mention a provided keyword (e.g., _applying MAC gold highlighter_)
4. View specific timelines or references of videos mentioning the keyword

This application utilizes [Twelve Labs API](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs) for the rich, contextual video search. Twelve Labs is an AI-powered video understanding platform that extracts various types of information from videos, such as movement and actions, objects and people, sound, text on screen, and speech.

## ‚ú® What is it for?

After years in beauty influencer marketing (now turned software engineer üòâ), one lesson stands out: the best partnerships come from creators who genuinely love your brand. But finding them isn‚Äôt always easy‚Äîespecially when your brand isn't named in the video title or description. I‚Äôve personally struggled with this, like when a YouTuber features a product organically but it‚Äôs nearly impossible to find via traditional search.

That‚Äôs why Who Talked About Us with Twelve Labs API is a game-changer. It goes beyond titles and tags to analyze video content‚Äîdetecting objects, actions, speech, and on-screen text. You can search phrases like ‚Äúapplying MAC gold highlighter‚Äù and uncover exactly when and where your product appears. This helps you build a list of authentic brand advocates, complete with rich context for smarter, more meaningful outreach.

From the bottom of the search results, you can effortlessly identify that Jean Watts, Risabae, Glamzilla, and Smitha Deepak mention "_MAC gold highlighter_," in their videos along with the exact moments of references. In contrast, the videos from 18 influencers including British Vogue did not feature such mentions. Armed with this comprehensive result, you can strategically prioritize reaching out to influencers like Jean and Risabe, armed with the right context for more impactful collaborations.

## üöò How to Use

1. Please create a new index or enter the index ID of a video you uploaded through _this app_. (‚ùóÔ∏èOnly videos indexed _via this app_ are supported)

2. Once you are inside an index, Begin by uploading videos in bulk to the app using either YouTube [playlist ID](https://www.sociablekit.com/find-youtube-playlist-id/#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20target%20YouTube,playlist%20ID%20is%20PLFs4vir_WsTwEd%2DnJgVJCZPNL3HALHHpF), [channel ID](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/find-a-youtube-channel-id/), or JSON file.

   - A YouTube playlist and channel should be public
   - The format of a JSON file should follow below structure

     ```
     [
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" },
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" }
      ...
     ]
     ```

3. Once the videos are uploaded, you can conduct a search using any keyword. Here are some suggestions:

   - Enter your brand name or product name and discover who's already talking about you in their videos
   - Enter your competitors' brand names to see what types of influencers they're attracting
   - You can also search for very specific or contextual keywords such as "_applying MAC gold highlighter_" or "_holding Gentle Monster sunglasses_"!

4. The search results will be shown grouped by each channel (influencer) and video, displaying moments in videos where your keyword is mentioned or featured.

5. Based on these results, you can prioritize influencers and begin your outreach efforts, forging partnerships that can expand your brand reach and influence. Remember, success in influencer marketing is all about forming authentic partnerships!
