## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

"Who Talked About Us?" is an influencer-filtering app where a user can:

1. Create an index (a library of videos)
2. Upload YouTube videos in bulk by (public) playlist ID, channel ID, or JSON file
3. Filter the videos and channels that mention a provided keyword (e.g., _applying MAC gold highlighter_)
4. View specific timelines or references of videos mentioning the keyword

This application utilizes [Twelve Labs API](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs) for the rich, contextual video search. Twelve Labs is an AI-powered video understanding platform that extracts various types of information from videos, such as movement and actions, objects and people, sound, text on screen, and speech.
