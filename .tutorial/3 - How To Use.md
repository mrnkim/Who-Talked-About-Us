## ðŸš˜ How to Use

1. Either create a new index or provide an index id of the existing index that you already created/uploaded videos _directly through this app_ before. You can look up the index ids by [listing indexes](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/v1.2/reference/list-indexes).

   - This app _only_ supports the videos uploaded/indexed directly through this app

2. Once you are inside an index, Begin by uploading videos in bulk to the app using either YouTube [playlist ID](https://www.sociablekit.com/find-youtube-playlist-id/#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20target%20YouTube,playlist%20ID%20is%20PLFs4vir_WsTwEd%2DnJgVJCZPNL3HALHHpF), [channel ID](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/find-a-youtube-channel-id/), or JSON file.

   - A YouTube playlist and channel should be public
   - The format of a JSON file should follow below structure

     ```
     [
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" },
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" }
      ...
     ]
     ```

3. Once the videos are uploaded, you can conduct a search using any keyword. Here are some suggestions:

   - Enter your brand name or product name and discover who's already talking about you in their videos
   - Enter your competitors' brand names to see what types of influencers they're attracting
   - You can also search for very specific or contextual keywords such as "_applying MAC gold highlighter_" or "_holding Gentle Monster sunglasses_"!

4. The search results will be shown grouped by each channel (influencer) and video, displaying moments in videos where your keyword is mentioned or featured.

5. Based on these results, you can prioritize influencers and begin your outreach efforts, forging partnerships that can expand your brand reach and influence. Remember, success in influencer marketing is all about forming authentic partnerships!
