## âœ¨ What is it for?

After years of experience in influencer partnerships as a marketing professional in the beauty industry, I've learned a valuable lesson in selecting the ideal YouTube or TikTok influencer for a brand. (Yes, Iâ€™m a marketing professional turned software engineer ðŸ˜‰). The most successful collaborations tend to happen organically with influencers who are already genuine enthusiasts of your products or brand. However, identifying these influencers can be challenging, especially when your brand isn't explicitly mentioned in video titles or descriptions. This has been a personal pain point, such as when a YouTuber features your product in a video without explicitly naming your brand, making it hard to discover through conventional searches.

That's where the Who Talked About Us with Twelve Labs API can be a game-changer. Unlike traditional YouTube or TikTok searches, this API enables deep contextual video searches by extracting various elements from videos, including movements, objects, people, sounds, on-screen text, and speech. By inputting keywords or specific descriptions, such as "_applying MAC gold highlighter_," you can uncover videos discussing your brand or products with precise moments of reference. This innovative approach empowers you to build a targeted list of influencers, complete with details about the products they've mentioned and the context, providing valuable insights for more effective engagement and meaningful connections.

Armed with this comprehensive result, you can strategically prioritize reaching out to influencers like Jean and Risabe, armed with the right context for more impactful collaborations.
